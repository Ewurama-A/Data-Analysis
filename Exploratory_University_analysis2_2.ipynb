    "##### Analyzing data from Universities around the world and Preparing data for a Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebook explored how relationships can be drawn and interpreted using graphs and statistical methods. This notebook does the same, whilst preparing the data for a dashboard using feature engineering. Seaborn may be used to visualize the simple relationships for inferences. Plotly will be used for the final dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions that will be answered are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which schools have the top scores in  \n",
    "- teaching\n",
    "- research \n",
    "- citation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which schools have a higher male poupulation or female population?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which schools have high number of international students?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions will be used to build the dashboard, along with a mapto show the locations of the universities. The data used is the original **uncleaned** dataset from Kaggle along with the **cleaned and filtered** data. Pandas will be used to show how joining dataframes work in data analysis ^.\n",
